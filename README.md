# C&AI Intern Hack for Social Good

## Overview

Let’s combine forces to hack for good! Join your fellow interns in a weekend hackathon creating solutions to help solve the tough problems impacting all of us. You’ll form groups across Cloud and AI to hack over the weekend of June 20-21. Be mentored by Cloud Advocates, Microsoft notables, and get inspired for the Imagine Cup. The three winning teams will have the opportunity to win $5000, $3000, or $2000 the charity of their choice and the winning team will win Surface Gos for each member.  An additional $5000 donation will be donated to Code.org on behalf of this Hackathon.
 
Limited to the first 500 who sign up, so join us quickly!

### Team formation

With 500 total participants expected, team sizes will be diverse. 

You are free to form teams however you see fit! You can meet new friends, or work with a pre-existing team.

### Project requirements

- At the end of the day your team will be delivering a **five minute** presentation which meets these criteria:
  - At most two slides to highlight the architecture and technologies used
  - Demonstrates the application (live demo encouraged!)
  - No videos or other external media
- The project needs to incorporate Azure services, such as the following:
  - App Services
  - Bot Services
  - Cognitive Services
  - Databases
  - Internet of Things
  - Machine Learning Services
  - Virtual Machines
- Use of open source software and other external resources is completely acceptable
- **All code** and other resources must be created during the event; no existing work from the team can be used during the hack event. This includes your recent Imagine Cup project.
- The project needs to serve social good or the betterment of others

### Presentations and judging

At the end of the available hacking time, each team will have one or more representatives deliver a five minute presentation on their team's project. The goal of the presentation is to highlight what your team built, how the solution works, and what your team is most proud of. Your team is free to use slides or other presentation media, or to focus solely on the solution your team built.

Presentation order will be determined by random selection. Teams will be informed of the presentation order at 15:50, 10 minutes before presentations begin. Once presentations begin at 16:00, all development must end.

#### Scoring

- Does the project address a clear need, problem, or opportunity, and is the solution clearly explained?
  - 10 points
- Does the project include innovations in technical design or implementation of services or user experience?
  - 20 points
- Does the project have a clear target market or audience?
  - 5 points
- Is the project's purpose and basic functionality easily understood?
  - 5 points
- Does the project have a professional degree of production in terms of performance, user interface, visuals, and audio?
  - 10 points

## Hack notes

### Tips and tricks

Remember the goal is to create a working solution as a team. With the short amount of time available, this will only be accomplished if your team works as a team. Divide and conquer the work. Lean on people's strengths. Get everyone involved, and listen to all ideas!

### Suggested challenges

While your team is free to come up with their own idea, there is a **limited amount of time** available for hacking. To help your team out, we've provided a set [challenges](./challenges.md) for use as a starting point. **We strong suggest starting with these [challenges](./challenges.md)!**

Every challenge provided includes a set of resources to help jump start development, and improve your team's chances for success. Remember, your team is required to present the solution at the end of the day, with the expectation a working proof of concept will be completed.

If your team does decide to create your own project, it must meet the criteria above.

**Happy hacking!**
